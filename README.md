## sfnetworks-hackathon

We had an amazing and very productive hackathon working on [four issues](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Ahackathon+label%3Aselected+) related to `sfnetworks` applications or further implementation (including some nice insight also into multi-modal routing with dodgr!). 

Some outcomes of the hackathon are documented on their own repository on [this organization](https://github.com/sfnetworks), here is a link to each topic:

- [Slope-sensitive routing](https://github.com/sfnetworks/sloperouting)
- [Estimation of basic exploratory data analysis measures](https://github.com/sfnetworks/ESDA)
- [Visualization of sfnetworks objects](https://github.com/sfnetworks/sfnetworks_viz)

We are sure that the amazing hackathon work will result in really good pull requests to the relevant packages!
