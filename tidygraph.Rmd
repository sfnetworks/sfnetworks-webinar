# Tidygraph for geospatial

## activate
```{r}

# Nodes are activated by default
graph
```

```{r}

## algorithms
```{r}
# Algorithms know the graph and the nodes
graph %>% 
  mutate(
    centrality = centrality_pagerank()

```

```{r}
# Recycling is enforced

## Morphing
```{r}
# You pass a morpher to morph()
graph %>% 
  morph(to_shortest_path, from = 1, to = 35)
```

```{r}
# Get back to the original graph with unmorph()
graph %>% 
  morph(to_shortest_path, from = 1, to = 35) %>% 
  mutate(on_path = TRUE) %>% 
  unmorph()
```
